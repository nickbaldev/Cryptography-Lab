WHEN IT GREW DARK THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME EuCITEMENT AMONGST THE
PASSENGERS AND THEY KEPT SPEAKING TO HIM ONE AFTER THE OTHER AS
THOUGH URGING HIM TO FURTHER SPEED HE LASHED THE HORSES UNMERCIFULLY
WITH HIS LONG WHIP AND WITH WILD CRIES OF ENCOURAGEMENT URGED THEM ON
TO FURTHER EuERTIONS THEN THROUGH THE DARKNESS I COULD SEE A SORT OF
PATCH OF GREY LIGHT AHEAD OF US AS THOUGH THERE WERE A CLEFT IN THE
HILLS THE EuCITEMENT OF THE PASSENGERS GREW GREATER THE CRAZY COACH
ROCKED ON ITS GREAT LEATHER SPRINGS AND SWAYED LIKE A BOAT TOSSED ON A
STORMY SEA I HAD TO HOLD ON THE ROAD GREW MORE LEVEL AND WE APPEARED
TO FLY ALONG THEN THE MOUNTAINS SEEMED TO COME NEARER TO US ON EACH
SIDE AND TO FROWN DOWN UPON US WE WERE ENTERING ON THE BORGO PASS ONE
BY ONE SEVERAL OF THE PASSENGERS OFFERED ME GIFTS WHICH THEY PRESSED
UPON ME WITH AN EARNESTNESS WHICH WOULD TAKE NO DENIAL THESE WERE
CERTAINLY OF AN ODD AND VARIED KIND BUT EACH WAS GIVEN IN SIMPLE GOOD
FAITH WITH A KINDLY WORD AND A BLESSING AND THAT STRANGE MIuTURE OF
FEARMEANING MOVEMENTS WHICH I HAD SEEN OUTSIDE THE HOTEL AT
BISTRITZTHE SIGN OF THE CROSS AND THE GUARD AGAINST THE EVIL EYE
THEN AS WE FLEW ALONG THE DRIVER LEANED FORWARD AND ON EACH SIDE THE
PASSENGERS CRANING OVER THE EDGE OF THE COACH PEERED EAGERLY INTO THE
DARKNESS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT SOMETHING VERY EuCITING WAS EITHER
HAPPENING OR EuPECTED BUT THOUGH I ASKED EACH PASSENGER NO ONE WOULD
GIVE ME THE SLIGHTEST EuPLANATION THIS STATE OF EuCITEMENT KEPT ON FOR
SOME LITTLE TIME AND AT LAST WE SAW BEFORE US THE PASS OPENING OUT ON
THE EASTERN SIDE THERE WERE DARK ROLLING CLOUDS OVERHEAD AND IN THE
AIR THE HEAVY OPPRESSIVE SENSE OF THUNDER IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THE
MOUNTAIN RANGE HAD SEPARATED TWO ATMOSPHERES AND THAT NOW WE HAD GOT
INTO THE THUNDEROUS ONE I WAS NOW MYSELF LOOKING OUT FOR THE CONVEYANCE
WHICH WAS TO TAKE ME TO THE COUNT EACH MOMENT I EuPECTED TO SEE THE
GLARE OF LAMPS THROUGH THE BLACKNESS BUT ALL WAS DARK THE ONLY LIGHT
WAS THE FLICKERING RAYS OF OUR OWN LAMPS IN WHICH THE STEAM FROM OUR
HARDDRIVEN HORSES ROSE IN A WHITE CLOUD WE COULD SEE NOW THE SANDY
ROAD LYING WHITE BEFORE US BUT THERE WAS ON IT NO SIGN OF A VEHICLE
THE PASSENGERS DREW BACK WITH A SIGH OF GLADNESS WHICH SEEMED TO MOCK
MY OWN DISAPPOINTMENT I WAS ALREADY THINKING WHAT I HAD BEST DO WHEN
THE DRIVER LOOKING AT HIS WATCH SAID TO THE OTHERS SOMETHING WHICH I
COULD HARDLY HEAR IT WAS SPOKEN SO QUIETLY AND IN SO LOW A TONE I
THOUGHT IT WAS AN HOUR LESS THAN THE TIME THEN TURNING TO ME HE SAID
IN GERMAN WORSE THAN MY OWN

THERE IS NO CARRIAGE HERE THE HERR IS NOT EuPECTED AFTER ALL HE WILL
NOW COME ON TO BUKOVINA AND RETURN TOMORROW OR THE NEuT DAY BETTER
THE NEuT DAY WHILST HE WAS SPEAKING THE HORSES BEGAN TO NEIGH AND
SNORT AND PLUNGE WILDLY SO THAT THE DRIVER HAD TO HOLD THEM UP THEN
AMONGST A CHORUS OF SCREAMS FROM THE PEASANTS AND A UNIVERSAL CROSSING
OF THEMSELVES A CALCHE WITH FOUR HORSES DROVE UP BEHIND US OVERTOOK
US AND DREW UP BESIDE THE COACH I COULD SEE FROM THE FLASH OF OUR
LAMPS AS THE RAYS FELL ON THEM THAT THE HORSES WERE COALBLACK AND
SPLENDID ANIMALS THEY WERE DRIVEN BY A TALL MAN WITH A LONG BROWN
BEARD AND A GREAT BLACK HAT WHICH SEEMED TO HIDE HIS FACE FROM US I
COULD ONLY SEE THE GLEAM OF A PAIR OF VERY BRIGHT EYES WHICH SEEMED RED
IN THE LAMPLIGHT AS HE TURNED TO US HE SAID TO THE DRIVER

YOU ARE EARLY TONIGHT MY FRIEND THE MAN STAMMERED IN REPLY

THE ENGLISH HERR WAS IN A HURRY TO WHICH THE STRANGER REPLIED

THAT IS WHY I SUPPOSE YOU WISHED HIM TO GO ON TO BUKOVINA YOU CANNOT
DECEIVE ME MY FRIEND I KNOW TOO MUCH AND MY HORSES ARE SWIFT AS HE
SPOKE HE SMILED AND THE LAMPLIGHT FELL ON A HARDLOOKING MOUTH WITH
VERY RED LIPS AND SHARPLOOKING TEETH AS WHITE AS IVORY ONE OF MY
COMPANIONS WHISPERED TO ANOTHER THE LINE FROM BURGERS LENORE

    FOR THE DEAD TRAVEL FAST

THE STRANGE DRIVER EVIDENTLY HEARD THE WORDS FOR HE LOOKED UP WITH A
GLEAMING SMILE THE PASSENGER TURNED HIS FACE AWAY AT THE SAME TIME
PUTTING OUT HIS TWO FINGERS AND CROSSING HIMSELF GIVE ME THE HERRS
LUGGAGE SAID THE DRIVER AND WITH EuCEEDING ALACRITY MY BAGS WERE
HANDED OUT AND PUT IN THE CALCHE THEN I DESCENDED FROM THE SIDE OF THE
COACH AS THE CALCHE WAS CLOSE ALONGSIDE THE DRIVER HELPING ME WITH A
HAND WHICH CAUGHT MY ARM IN A GRIP OF STEEL HIS STRENGTH MUST HAVE BEEN
PRODIGIOUS WITHOUT A WORD HE SHOOK HIS REINS THE HORSES TURNED AND WE
SWEPT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE PASS AS I LOOKED BACK I SAW THE STEAM
FROM THE HORSES OF THE COACH BY THE LIGHT OF THE LAMPS AND PROJECTED
AGAINST IT THE FIGURES OF MY LATE COMPANIONS CROSSING THEMSELVES THEN
THE DRIVER CRACKED HIS WHIP AND CALLED TO HIS HORSES AND OFF THEY SWEPT
ON THEIR WAY TO BUKOVINA AS THEY SANK INTO THE DARKNESS I FELT A
STRANGE CHILL AND A LONELY FEELING CAME OVER ME BUT A CLOAK WAS THROWN
OVER MY SHOULDERS AND A RUG ACROSS MY KNEES AND THE DRIVER SAID IN
EuCELLENT GERMAN

THE NIGHT IS CHILL MEIN HERR AND MY MASTER THE COUNT BADE ME TAKE ALL
CARE OF YOU THERE IS A FLASK OF SLIVOVITZ THE PLUM BRANDY OF THE
COUNTRY UNDERNEATH THE SEAT IF YOU SHOULD REQUIRE IT I DID NOT TAKE
ANY BUT IT WAS A COMFORT TO KNOW IT WAS THERE ALL THE SAME I FELT A
LITTLE STRANGELY AND NOT A LITTLE FRIGHTENED I THINK HAD THERE BEEN
ANY ALTERNATIVE I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN IT INSTEAD OF PROSECUTING THAT
UNKNOWN NIGHT JOURNEY THE CARRIAGE WENT AT A HARD PACE STRAIGHT ALONG
THEN WE MADE A COMPLETE TURN AND WENT ALONG ANOTHER STRAIGHT ROAD IT
SEEMED TO ME THAT WE WERE SIMPLY GOING OVER AND OVER THE SAME GROUND
AGAIN AND SO I TOOK NOTE OF SOME SALIENT POINT AND FOUND THAT THIS WAS
SO I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE ASKED THE DRIVER WHAT THIS ALL MEANT BUT
I REALLY FEARED TO DO SO FOR I THOUGHT THAT PLACED AS I WAS ANY
PROTEST WOULD HAVE HAD NO EFFECT IN CASE THERE HAD BEEN AN INTENTION TO
DELAY BYANDBY HOWEVER AS I WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW TIME WAS
PASSING I STRUCK A MATCH AND BY ITS FLAME LOOKED AT MY WATCH IT WAS
WITHIN A FEW MINUTES OF MIDNIGHT THIS GAVE ME A SORT OF SHOCK FOR I
SUPPOSE THE GENERAL SUPERSTITION ABOUT MIDNIGHT WAS INCREASED BY MY
RECENT EuPERIENCES I WAITED WITH A SICK FEELING OF SUSPENSE

THEN A DOG BEGAN TO HOWL SOMEWHERE IN A FARMHOUSE FAR DOWN THE ROADA
LONG AGONISED WAILING AS IF FROM FEAR THE SOUND WAS TAKEN UP BY
ANOTHER DOG AND THEN ANOTHER AND ANOTHER TILL BORNE ON THE WIND WHICH
NOW SIGHED SOFTLY THROUGH THE PASS A WILD HOWLING BEGAN WHICH SEEMED
TO COME FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY AS FAR AS THE IMAGINATION COULD GRASP
IT THROUGH THE GLOOM OF THE NIGHT AT THE FIRST HOWL THE HORSES BEGAN TO
STRAIN AND REAR BUT THE DRIVER SPOKE TO THEM SOOTHINGLY AND THEY
QUIETED DOWN BUT SHIVERED AND SWEATED AS THOUGH AFTER A RUNAWAY FROM
SUDDEN FRIGHT THEN FAR OFF IN THE DISTANCE FROM THE MOUNTAINS ON EACH
SIDE OF US BEGAN A LOUDER AND A SHARPER HOWLINGTHAT OF WOLVESWHICH
AFFECTED BOTH THE HORSES AND MYSELF IN THE SAME WAYFOR I WAS MINDED TO
JUMP FROM THE CALCHE AND RUN WHILST THEY REARED AGAIN AND PLUNGED
MADLY SO THAT THE DRIVER HAD TO USE ALL HIS GREAT STRENGTH TO KEEP THEM
FROM BOLTING IN A FEW MINUTES HOWEVER MY OWN EARS GOT ACCUSTOMED TO
THE SOUND AND THE HORSES SO FAR BECAME QUIET THAT THE DRIVER WAS ABLE
TO DESCEND AND TO STAND BEFORE THEM HE PETTED AND SOOTHED THEM AND
WHISPERED SOMETHING IN THEIR EARS AS I HAVE HEARD OF HORSETAMERS
DOING AND WITH EuTRAORDINARY EFFECT FOR UNDER HIS CARESSES THEY BECAME
QUITE MANAGEABLE AGAIN THOUGH THEY STILL TREMBLED THE DRIVER AGAIN
TOOK HIS SEAT AND SHAKING HIS REINS STARTED OFF AT A GREAT PACE THIS
TIME AFTER GOING TO THE FAR SIDE OF THE PASS HE SUDDENLY TURNED DOWN A
NARROW ROADWAY WHICH RAN SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT

SOON WE WERE HEMMED IN WITH TREES WHICH IN PLACES ARCHED RIGHT OVER THE
ROADWAY TILL WE PASSED AS THROUGH A TUNNEL AND AGAIN GREAT FROWNING
ROCKS GUARDED US BOLDLY ON EITHER SIDE THOUGH WE WERE IN SHELTER WE
COULD HEAR THE RISING WIND FOR IT MOANED AND WHISTLED THROUGH THE
ROCKS AND THE BRANCHES OF THE TREES CRASHED TOGETHER AS WE SWEPT ALONG
IT GREW COLDER AND COLDER STILL AND FINE POWDERY SNOW BEGAN TO FALL
SO THAT SOON WE AND ALL AROUND US WERE COVERED WITH A WHITE BLANKET THE
KEEN WIND STILL CARRIED THE HOWLING OF THE DOGS THOUGH THIS GREW
FAINTER AS WE WENT ON OUR WAY THE BAYING OF THE WOLVES SOUNDED NEARER
AND NEARER AS THOUGH THEY WERE CLOSING ROUND ON US FROM EVERY SIDE I
GREW DREADFULLY AFRAID AND THE HORSES SHARED MY FEAR THE DRIVER
HOWEVER WAS NOT IN THE LEAST DISTURBED HE KEPT TURNING HIS HEAD TO
LEFT AND RIGHT BUT I COULD NOT SEE ANYTHING THROUGH THE DARKNESS

SUDDENLY AWAY ON OUR LEFT I SAW A FAINT FLICKERING BLUE FLAME THE
DRIVER SAW IT AT THE SAME MOMENT HE AT ONCE CHECKED THE HORSES AND
JUMPING TO THE GROUND DISAPPEARED INTO THE DARKNESS I DID NOT KNOW
WHAT TO DO THE LESS AS THE HOWLING OF THE WOLVES GREW CLOSER BUT WHILE
I WONDERED THE DRIVER SUDDENLY APPEARED AGAIN AND WITHOUT A WORD TOOK
HIS SEAT AND WE RESUMED OUR JOURNEY I THINK I MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP
AND KEPT DREAMING OF THE INCIDENT FOR IT SEEMED TO BE REPEATED
ENDLESSLY AND NOW LOOKING BACK IT IS LIKE A SORT OF AWFUL NIGHTMARE
ONCE THE FLAME APPEARED SO NEAR THE ROAD THAT EVEN IN THE DARKNESS
AROUND US I COULD WATCH THE DRIVERS MOTIONS HE WENT RAPIDLY TO WHERE
THE BLUE FLAME AROSEIT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY FAINT FOR IT DID NOT SEEM
TO ILLUMINE THE PLACE AROUND IT AT ALLAND GATHERING A FEW STONES
FORMED THEM INTO SOME DEVICE ONCE THERE APPEARED A STRANGE OPTICAL
EFFECT WHEN HE STOOD BETWEEN ME AND THE FLAME HE DID NOT OBSTRUCT IT
FOR I COULD SEE ITS GHOSTLY FLICKER ALL THE SAME THIS STARTLED ME BUT
AS THE EFFECT WAS ONLY MOMENTARY I TOOK IT THAT MY EYES DECEIVED ME
STRAINING THROUGH THE DARKNESS THEN FOR A TIME THERE WERE NO BLUE
FLAMES AND WE SPED ONWARDS THROUGH THE GLOOM WITH THE HOWLING OF THE
WOLVES AROUND US AS THOUGH THEY WERE FOLLOWING IN A MOVING CIRCLE

AT LAST THERE CAME A TIME WHEN THE DRIVER WENT FURTHER AFIELD THAN HE
HAD YET GONE AND DURING HIS ABSENCE THE HORSES BEGAN TO TREMBLE WORSE
THAN EVER AND TO SNORT AND SCREAM WITH FRIGHT I COULD NOT SEE ANY CAUSE
FOR IT FOR THE HOWLING OF THE WOLVES HAD CEASED ALTOGETHER BUT JUST
THEN THE MOON SAILING THROUGH THE BLACK CLOUDS APPEARED BEHIND THE
JAGGED CREST OF A BEETLING PINECLAD ROCK AND BY ITS LIGHT I SAW
AROUND US A RING OF WOLVES WITH WHITE TEETH AND LOLLING RED TONGUES
WITH LONG SINEWY LIMBS AND SHAGGY HAIR THEY WERE A HUNDRED TIMES MORE
TERRIBLE IN THE GRIM SILENCE WHICH HELD THEM THAN EVEN WHEN THEY HOWLED
FOR MYSELF I FELT A SORT OF PARALYSIS OF FEAR IT IS ONLY WHEN A MAN
FEELS HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH SUCH HORRORS THAT HE CAN UNDERSTAND
THEIR TRUE IMPORT

ALL AT ONCE THE WOLVES BEGAN TO HOWL AS THOUGH THE MOONLIGHT HAD HAD
SOME PECULIAR EFFECT ON THEM THE HORSES JUMPED ABOUT AND REARED AND
LOOKED HELPLESSLY ROUND WITH EYES THAT ROLLED IN A WAY PAINFUL TO SEE
BUT THE LIVING RING OF TERROR ENCOMPASSED THEM ON EVERY SIDE AND THEY
HAD PERFORCE TO REMAIN WITHIN IT I CALLED TO THE COACHMAN TO COME FOR
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT OUR ONLY CHANCE WAS TO TRY TO BREAK OUT THROUGH THE
RING AND TO AID HIS APPROACH I SHOUTED AND BEAT THE SIDE OF THE
CALCHE HOPING BY THE NOISE TO SCARE THE WOLVES FROM THAT SIDE SO AS
TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE OF REACHING THE TRAP HOW HE CAME THERE I KNOW
NOT BUT I HEARD HIS VOICE RAISED IN A TONE OF IMPERIOUS COMMAND AND
LOOKING TOWARDS THE SOUND SAW HIM STAND IN THE ROADWAY AS HE SWEPT HIS
LONG ARMS AS THOUGH BRUSHING ASIDE SOME IMPALPABLE OBSTACLE THE WOLVES
FELL BACK AND BACK FURTHER STILL JUST THEN A HEAVY CLOUD PASSED ACROSS
THE FACE OF THE MOON SO THAT WE WERE AGAIN IN DARKNESS

WHEN I COULD SEE AGAIN THE DRIVER WAS CLIMBING INTO THE CALCHE AND THE
WOLVES HAD DISAPPEARED THIS WAS ALL SO STRANGE AND UNCANNY THAT A
DREADFUL FEAR CAME UPON ME AND I WAS AFRAID TO SPEAK OR MOVE THE TIME
SEEMED INTERMINABLE AS WE SWEPT ON OUR WAY NOW IN ALMOST COMPLETE
DARKNESS FOR THE ROLLING CLOUDS OBSCURED THE MOON WE KEPT ON
ASCENDING WITH OCCASIONAL PERIODS OF QUICK DESCENT BUT IN THE MAIN
ALWAYS ASCENDING SUDDENLY I BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT THE
DRIVER WAS IN THE ACT OF PULLING UP THE HORSES IN THE COURTYARD OF A
VAST RUINED CASTLE FROM WHOSE TALL BLACK WINDOWS CAME NO RAY OF LIGHT
AND WHOSE BROKEN BATTLEMENTS SHOWED A JAGGED LINE AGAINST THE MOONLIT
SKY

CHAPTER II

JONATHAN HARKERS JOURNAL CONTINUED

I MUST HAVE BEEN ASLEEP FOR CERTAINLY IF I HAD BEEN FULLY
AWAKE I MUST HAVE NOTICED THE APPROACH OF SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE IN
THE GLOOM THE COURTYARD LOOKED OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE AND AS SEVERAL DARK
WAYS LED FROM IT UNDER GREAT ROUND ARCHES IT PERHAPS SEEMED BIGGER THAN
IT REALLY IS I HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO SEE IT BY DAYLIGHT

WHEN THE CALCHE STOPPED THE DRIVER JUMPED DOWN AND HELD OUT HIS HAND
TO ASSIST ME TO ALIGHT AGAIN I COULD NOT BUT NOTICE HIS PRODIGIOUS
STRENGTH HIS HAND ACTUALLY SEEMED LIKE A STEEL VICE THAT COULD HAVE
CRUSHED MINE IF HE HAD CHOSEN THEN HE TOOK OUT MY TRAPS AND PLACED
THEM ON THE GROUND BESIDE ME AS I STOOD CLOSE TO A GREAT DOOR OLD AND
STUDDED WITH LARGE IRON NAILS AND SET IN A PROJECTING DOORWAY OF
MASSIVE STONE I COULD SEE EVEN IN THE DIM LIGHT THAT THE STONE WAS
MASSIVELY CARVED BUT THAT THE CARVING HAD BEEN MUCH WORN BY TIME AND
WEATHER AS I STOOD THE DRIVER JUMPED AGAIN INTO HIS SEAT AND SHOOK THE
REINS THE HORSES STARTED FORWARD AND TRAP AND ALL DISAPPEARED DOWN ONE
OF THE DARK OPENINGS

I STOOD IN SILENCE WHERE I WAS FOR I DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO OF BELL
OR KNOCKER THERE WAS NO SIGN THROUGH THESE FROWNING WALLS AND DARK
WINDOW OPENINGS IT WAS NOT LIKELY THAT MY VOICE COULD PENETRATE THE
TIME I WAITED SEEMED ENDLESS AND I FELT DOUBTS AND FEARS CROWDING UPON
ME WHAT SORT OF PLACE HAD I COME TO AND AMONG WHAT KIND OF PEOPLE
WHAT SORT OF GRIM ADVENTURE WAS IT ON WHICH I HAD EMBARKED WAS THIS A
CUSTOMARY INCIDENT IN THE LIFE OF A SOLICITORS CLERK SENT OUT TO
EuPLAIN THE PURCHASE OF A LONDON ESTATE TO A FOREIGNER SOLICITORS
CLERK MINA WOULD NOT LIKE THAT SOLICITORFOR JUST BEFORE LEAVING
LONDON I GOT WORD THAT MY EuAMINATION WAS SUCCESSFUL AND I AM NOW A
FULLBLOWN SOLICITOR I BEGAN TO RUB MY EYES AND PINCH MYSELF TO SEE IF
I WERE AWAKE IT ALL SEEMED LIKE A HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE TO ME AND I
EuPECTED THAT I SHOULD SUDDENLY AWAKE AND FIND MYSELF AT HOME WITH
THE DAWN STRUGGLING IN THROUGH THE WINDOWS AS I HAD NOW AND AGAIN FELT
IN THE MORNING AFTER A DAY OF OVERWORK BUT MY FLESH ANSWERED THE
PINCHING TEST AND MY EYES WERE NOT TO BE DECEIVED I WAS INDEED AWAKE
AND AMONG THE CARPATHIANS ALL I COULD DO NOW WAS TO BE PATIENT AND TO
WAIT THE COMING OF THE MORNING
